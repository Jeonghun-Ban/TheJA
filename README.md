:open_book: Introduction
---

This app is designed for commuting or attending school. The basic function is `creating a personalized public transport list`. This makes us avoid the hassle of doing public transit searches every day. `TheJA` means `to sleep more` in Korean. It means that you can sleep a little better by reducing the time it takes to search.

In fact, this project started as a personal project in Myongji University's major class (mobile computing). In this version, it includes information on the concentration of `fine dust`, `temperature`, and `probability of precipitation` so that you do not forget your mask or umbrella.

Currently, what was developed as an Android app is being re-developed as a Flutter app. Not all features have been added yet.
